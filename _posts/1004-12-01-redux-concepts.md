### Core Concepts and Principles

#### Changes are Made with Pure Reducer Functions

<p align="left" style="font-size:24px">To specify <span style="color: #c0a8e7">how the state tree is updated based on actions, you write reducer functions.</span> Reducers are <span style="color: #c0a8e7">pure functions</span> that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Like any other functions, <span style="color: #c0a8e7">you can split reducers into smaller functions to help do the work, or write reusable reducers for common tasks.</span>
